        <h2>Stocks</h2>

        <p>Nottingham town had five sets of stocks; located at Weekday Cross, Timber Hill, Goose Gate, Bridge End, and outside the Exchange. The offender would have their feet strapped between two planks of wood. Punishment in the stocks generally lasted for several hours. During this time passers-by would throw all forms of disgusting waste at the offender such as rotten fruit, vegetables, and animal dung. Minor crimes such as public disorder, drunkenness, swearing, or vagrancy* were often punished by the use of the stocks. Their use began to die out in England during the early 19th century.</p>

        <p>*Vagrancy is having no home or job</p>
